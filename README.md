# Description
simple eBPF program that drops ICMP packets. It is written in C and uses the eBPF library and XDP to load the program into the kernel then outputs stats in the userspace program based on cilium-ebpf.

### Some details:

XDP allows for early packet interception at the network interface driver level.

The XDP eBPF program, implemented in C, hooks into the Linux kernelâ€™s networking stack at an early stage to intercept packets and decide their fate.

The accompanying Golang application interacts with the XDP eBPF program, providing a user-friendly interface to monitor the packet drop behavior and visualize performance statistics.
