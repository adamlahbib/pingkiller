# Description
simple eBPF program that drops ICMP packets. It is written in C and uses the eBPF library and XDP to load the program into the kernel then outputs stats in the userspace program based on cilium-ebpf.

### Some details:

XDP allows for early packet interception at the network interface driver level.

The XDP eBPF program, implemented in C, hooks into the Linux kernelâ€™s networking stack at an early stage to intercept packets and decide their fate.

The accompanying Golang application interacts with the XDP eBPF program, providing a user-friendly interface to monitor the packet drop behavior and visualize performance statistics.

### Prerequisites:
Clang and LLVM:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install clang llvm
```

bpftool:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool.git
cd src
make
sudo make install
```
Golang:
```
sudo apt install golang
```

### How to run:

Compile the XDP program using the following command:

```bash
clang -S \
    -g \
    -target bpf \
    -I../../libbpf/src\
    -Wall \
    -Werror \
    -O2 -emit-llvm -c -o dicmp_kern.ll dicmp_kern.c
```

Which will generate the LLVM IR file dicmp_kern.ll, then use the llc tool to compile the LLVM IR file to BPF bytecode, as follows:
```
llc -march=bpf -filetype=obj -O2 -o dicmp_kern.o dicmp_kern.ll
```

Run the userspace program:
```
go mod init dicmp
go mod tidy
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build . 
sudo ./dicmp

```
